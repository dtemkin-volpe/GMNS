# Small network examples

## Current examples
Examples of small networks implemented include:
- [Cambridge, MA](Cambridge_v090), a multimodal intersection near the Volpe Center. 
- [Burlington, MA](Freeway_Interchange), an example of a freeway interchange.
- [Arlington, MA](Arlington_Signals), an example of coordinated signals with multiple timing plans.
- [Lima, OH](Lima/GMNS), an example of a small city.
- [Connecticut Ave, Washington DC](TOD_Examples/CT_Ave.md), an example of time of day changes.
- [I-93, north of Boston](TOD_Examples/I-93.md), another example of time of day changes.

The examples that use the optional `allowed_uses` field all use the same `use_definition` and `use_group` files, which can be found in this parent folder.
