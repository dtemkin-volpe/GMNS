# Source network for Lima dataset

This dataset was developed by the Ohio Department of Transportation as a pilot for the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) C10 project. The dataset can be downloaded from the [DynusT website](https://www.dynust.com/).

Not all of the DynusT input files are needed to generate a GMNS network. For details on how this network was converted to GMNS format, see the [README](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS/tree/master/Conversion_Tools#dynust) in the conversion tools folder and the associated [R script](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS/blob/master/Conversion_Tools/DynusT/DynusT_to_GMNS.R).
