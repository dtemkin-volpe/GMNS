## Proposing Edits to this Repository
This repository hosts the specification itself, as well as some small demo examples and tools demonstrating how the spec works.
At this time, code or datasets (aside from the simple examples that already appear) should not be included in this repository; developers should instead create their own repositories for their work. If you're using GMNS, please let us know by submitting a pull request to the "Known Packages Using GMNS" section of this file below.

## Submitting a Pull Request
If you have suggested edits to the specification, you can submit your proposed changes through a Pull Request. To do this, you can fork this repository, make your proposed changes on your local copy, and then submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS/compare).

## Review Process
Once work on a pull request is complete, the GMNS Project Management Committee will review the request. Discussion may occur via commenting on the PR, or for more substantive changes, a meeting of the PMC may be called. After discussion, the PMC Chair will call a vote of PMC members using the procedures outlined in the Governance Document.
