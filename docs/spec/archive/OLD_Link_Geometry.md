#	link_geometry	
The link_geometry is a foundational object that contains the physical
characteristics of the links used in GMNS. A link object can
(optionally) reference this object to include physical information in
the network. Currently, GMNS uses road links (for places where vehicles
operate in lanes in a single direction) and offroad links (for
pedestrian facilities, which are undirected). A future version of GMNS
may expand to other types of links. Multiple network links can reference
the same Link_Geometry (for example, two directions on a road may share
the same line geometry). The Link_Geometry field is similar to the concept of a
[way](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way) in OpenStreetMap.
