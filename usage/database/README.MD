Although GMNS is implementation-agnostic, some users may find it convenient to place GMNS-formatted networks into a relational database.  This folder contains an empty SQLite database, as well as the sql create statements.  There are two versions:
-  Integer_IDs: The ID fields (primary and foreign keys on the tables) are stored as integers
-  Text_IDs:  The ID fields (primary and foreign keys on the tables) are stored as text
