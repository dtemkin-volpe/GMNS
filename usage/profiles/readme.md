# Introduction

GMNS is a large specification, but a particular application is unlikely
to need every field in every table. This is why most fields are
optional. This document presents several use cases, showing which parts
of GMNS are required for each use case, and which are not. Each section
briefly describes each use case, followed by an indication of which GMNS
tables and fields are required to support that use case.
