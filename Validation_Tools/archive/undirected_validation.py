# GMNS Validation Tool: Undirected Validation With NetworkX

# Inputs: Nodes.csv and Links.csv from a GMNS formatted network
# (required: the optional field Node_Type in the Nodes.csv)

# Output: Prints to screen information and warnings:
## First, a warning highlights nodes that may have too many or too few neighbors based on their Node_Type
## Second, either a statement that the network is connected; or, a list of links not connected to the largest component
## Third, a list of isolated nodes, which should be reviewed by the user
## Fourth, the network is drawn on the screen (without shape information)
