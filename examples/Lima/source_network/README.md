# Source network for Lima dataset

This dataset was developed by the Ohio Department of Transportation as a pilot for the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) C10 project. The dataset can be downloaded from the [DynusT website](https://www.dynust.com/).

Not all of the DynusT input files are needed to generate a GMNS network; only those used in conversion appear in this repository. For details on how this network was converted to GMNS format, including limitations to that conversion, see the [README](/usage/conversion#dynust) in the conversion tools folder and the associated [R script](/usage/conversion/DynusT/DynusT_to_GMNS.R) .
