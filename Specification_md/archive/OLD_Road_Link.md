# road\_link

A **road\_link** is a directed edge in a network, defined by the
nodes it travels from and to. It may have associated geometry, as
defined by a reference to the [link_geometry](Link_Geometry.md) table. Links have three
types of attributes:

  - Those that define the physical location of the link, inherited from
    Link_Geometry (e.g., shape information, length,
    width), which can be referenced with the foreign key link_geom_id

  - Those that define the link’s directionality: from\_node, to\_node

  - Those that define properties in the direction of travel: capacity,
    free flow speed, number of lanes, permitted uses, grade, facility type

Note on the _lanes_ field: This field is maintained for compatibility with static models, where
    the Lanes table is not used. Here, it is treated as the number of
    permanent lanes (not including turn pockets) open to motor vehicles.
    Therefore, a link which acts solely as a contra-flow bike lane will
    have a number of lanes = 0.
