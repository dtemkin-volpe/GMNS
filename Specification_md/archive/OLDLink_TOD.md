# link_tod

link_tod is an optional file that handles day-of-week and time-of-day
restrictions on links and lanes. It is used for tolls (which may differ by
time-of-day), peak hour shoulder use, reversible lanes, and part time
parking lanes. Since tolls often vary by time of day, they are placed in
this file.
