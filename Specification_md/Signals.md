#	Signals	

Representation of traffic controls (e.g., stop signs, signals, etc.) includes several considerations:  
- For static networks, the node may include the type of traffic control (e.g., unknown, no control, yield, 4-way stop, signal, 2-way stop, roundabout)
- The link includes functional class and number of lanes
- With basic information on the node and link, a reasonable approximation of traffic control configuration (e.g., which approach is being stopped) for static models can be made from the above information
- For dynamic models, basic control information can be included in the movement file.  Controls include unknown, no control, yield, 4-way stop, 2-way stop, signal, signal_with_RTOR. Note that different movements and lanes at an intersection may have different controls (e.g., a Stop Except Right Turn sign)   

Traffic signals call for several additional files:
- `signal_controller` has one record for each signal controller.  Typically, each node that represents an intersection has one signal controller, but there are cases where one signal controller might be associated with several nodes (e.g.,  two sides of a divided highway at a crossroads).  
- A controller will be associated with at least one timing plan. When signals are coordinated, a signal timing plan may be associated with a second controller through the `signal_coordination` file.
- A signal timing phase record indicates the ring, barrier, and position (RBP) for each phase of the signal. A signal phase is associated with at least one signal timing plan.  If timing plans vary by time of day or day or week, the signal phase will be associated with multiple timing plans.  
- Each signal phase is associated with a controller and with one or more movements (for traffic movements) or links (for crosswalks) that may move on that phase.  Similarly, movements may move on more than one signal phase. These are indicated in the `signal_phase_mvmt` table. 
- `signal_detector` is an optional file for detectors (used for actuated signals)

## signal_timing_phase

The following conventions are typically used for phase numbers (see figure):

  - Main street through movements are allowed on phases 2 and 6

  - Protected left turns from the main street are allowed on phases 1
    and 5

  - Side street through movements are allowed on phases 4 and 8

  - Protected left turns from the side street are allowed on phases 3
    and 7

  - Right turns are handed in one of two ways
    
      - Concurrently with the associated through movement. For example,
        if the through movement for the main street eastbound is on
        Phase 2, the right turn from the main street eastbound is also
        on Phase 2
    
      - Concurrently with the non-conflicting left turn movement from
        the side street. This is possible with dedicated right-turn
        lanes and can reduce pedestrian conflicts. In this case, the
        right turn from the main street eastbound would occur during
        Phase 3 (left turn from the side street northbound).

  - An exclusive pedestrian phase will be assigned a phase number higher
    than 8.

Finally, note that in the figure below, the phases connected by solid lines may not
operate concurrently, while phases connected by dashed lines may operate
concurrently.

For signalized nodes, establishes phases that may run concurrently, using ring-barrier notation.  Each phase is associated with a ring and a barrier.  In order to run concurrently, two phases must be in:
-	the same barrier, and
-	different rings

For example, in the diagram above, the phases are associated with rings and barriers as follows:
<table>
<tr> <td>Phases</td> <th colspan="2">Barrier 1</th> <th colspan="2">Barrier 2</th> </tr>
<tr> <th>Ring 1</th> <td>2</td> <td>1</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Ring 2</th> <td>5</td> <td>6</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> </tr>
</table>

This table also provides signal timings, which may be different for each timing plan.
